# NWNLogRotator
Transforms and parses any Neverwinter Nights chat log into beautiful HTML. Written in C# .NET WPF, and is a WIP!

# Notes
1) This exe is unsigned and will probably prevent it from running unless you click "More Info" -> "Run anyways". It is simply not finished, nor published anywhere.
2) If open the log rotator, then NWN, then it detects the window, and then detects you quit, it will try to process the log automatically. This behavior will be refined soon.
3) Please report any terrible bugs, I release a lot of it is simply not done but it helps.
