# NWNLogRotator
Transforms and parses any Neverwinter Nights chat log into beautiful HTML. Written in C# .NET WPF, and is a WIP! Both EE and 1.69 compatible.

# Automation
While open, NWNLogRotator will try process new logs automatically if your directories are configured to match with your Neverwinter Nights default log storage.

# Notes
1) This application may warn you that the publisher is not signed or verified, but if you click 'More Info' it will allow you to run anyways.
2) Minimize to tray is not finished or implemented at all.
3) This will probably not work with servers who artificially inject invalid log sequences into the combat log.
4) Please report any bugs or post suggestions.
